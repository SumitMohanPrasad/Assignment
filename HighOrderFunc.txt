Q1. Describe higher order functions.
Answer: A higher order functions takes another function as an argument or returns a function .
some built in higher order functions are:-
1)map
2)reduce 
3)filter

map :-map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element and it calls a function once for each element in an array.
reduce:-it returns a single value after desired calculation.
filter:- it filters the array,object on certain condition.

Q2. write use cases + any one code example for map, filter and reduce.
Answer:
1)Example using map
  let num=[2,3,4,5,6];
  num.map((n)=>n*3);
  it thrice the given array.
  ouput-Â [6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

2) Example using reduce
   let num=[2,3,4,5,6];
  num.reduce((a,b)=>a+=b);
  it add the element of array and give output as 20.

3)Example using filter
   let num=[2,3,4,5,6];
      num.filter((n)=>n%2==0);
    it will filter the array element and gives even number as ouput.
    output-Â [2, 4, 6]
